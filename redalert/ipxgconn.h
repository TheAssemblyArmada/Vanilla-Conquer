 * This class is a special type of IPX Connection.  It can talk to more		*
 * than one system at a time.  It can Broadcast packets to all systems,		*
 * or send a packet to one individual system.  The packets it sends to		*
 * individual systems can be DATA_NOACK or DATA_ACK packets, but the			*
 * packets broadcast have to be DATA_NOACK packets.  This class is for		*
 * only the crudest "Who-are-you" type of network communications.  Once		*
 * the IPX Address of another system is identified, a "real" IPX				*
 * Connection should be created, & further communications done through it.	*
 *																									*
 * This means that the packet ID field no longer can be used to detect		*
 * resends, since the receive queue may receive a lot more packets than		*
 * we send out.  So, re-sends cannot be detected; the application must be	*
 * designed so that it can handle multiple copies of the same packet.		*
 *																									*
 * The class uses a slightly different header from the normal Connections;	*
 * this header includes the ProductID of the sender, so multiple 				*
 * applications can share the same socket, but by using different product	*
 * ID's, can distinguish between their own packets & others.					*
 *																									*
 *	Because of this additional header, and because Receive ACK/Retry logic	*
 * is different (we can't detect resends), the following routines are		*
 * overloaded:																					*
 *		Send_Packet:		must embed the product ID into the packet header	*
 *		Receive_Packet:	must detect resends via the LastAddress & 			*
 *								LastPacketID arrays. This class doesn't ACK 			*
 *								packets until Service_Receive_Queue is called; 		*
 *								the parent classes ACK the packet when it's 			*
 *								received.														*
 *		Get_Packet:			extracts the product ID from the header;				*
 *								doesn't care about reading packets in order			*
 *		Send					is capable of broadcasting the packet, or sending	*
 *								to a specific address										*
 *																									*
 *	This class also has the ability to cross a Novell Network Bridge.			*
 * You provide the class with the bridge address, and subsequent				*
 * broadcasts are sent across the bridge as well as to the local network.	*
 * Address-specific sends contain the destination network's address,			*
 * so they cross a bridge automatically; it's just the broadcasts				*
 * that need to know the bridge address.												*
