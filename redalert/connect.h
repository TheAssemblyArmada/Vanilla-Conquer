 * DESCRIPTION:																				*
 * This class represents a single "connection" with another system.  It's	*
 * a pure virtual base class that acts as a framework for other classes.	*
 *																									*
 * This class contains a CommBufferClass member, which stores received		*
 * & transmitted packets.  The ConnectionClass has virtual functions to		*
 * handle adding packets to the queue, reading them from the queue,			*
 * a Send routine for actually sending data, and a Receive_Packet function *
 * which is used to tell the connection that a new packet has come in.		*
 *																									*
 * The virtual Service routines handle all ACK & Retry logic for				*
 * communicating between this system & another.  Thus, any class derived	*
 * from this class may overload the basic ACK/Retry logic.						*
 *                                                                         *
 * THE PACKET HEADER:																		*
 * The Connection Classes prefix every packet sent with a header that's		*
 * local to this class.  The header contains a "Magic Number" which should	*
 * be unique for each product, and Packet "Code", which will tell the		*
 * receiving end if this is DATA, or an ACK packet, and a packet ID, which	*
 * is a unique numerical ID for this packet (useful for detecting resends).*
 * The header is stored with each packet in the send & receive Queues; 		*
 * it's removed before it's passed back to the application, via				*
 * Get_Packet()																				*
 *                                                                         *
 * THE CONNECTION MANAGER:																	*
 * It is assumed that there will be a "Connection Manager" class which 		*
 * will handle parsing incoming packets; it will then tell the connection	*
 * that new packets have come in, and the connection will process them in	*
 * whatever way it needs to for its protocol (check for resends, handle		*
 * ACK packets, etc).  The job of the connection manager is to parse			*
 * incoming packets & distribute them to the connections that need to		*
 * store them (for multi-connection protocols).										*
 *                                                                         *
 * NOTES ON ACK/RETRY:																		*
 * This class provides a "non-sequenced" ACK/Retry approach to packet		*
 * transmission.  It sends out as many packets as are in the queue, whose	*
 * resend delta times have expired; and it ACK's any packets its received	*
 * who haven't been ACK'd yet.  Thus, order of delivery is NOT guaranteed;	*
 * but, the performance is better than a "sequenced" approach.  Also, the	*
 * Packet ID scheme (see below) ensures that the application will read		*
 * the packets in the proper order.  Thus, this class guarantees delivery	*
 * and order of deliver.																	*
 *																									*
 * Each packet has a unique numerical ID; the ID is set to a count of the	*
 * number of packets sent.  Different count values are provided, for both 	*
 * DATA_ACK & DATA_NOACK packets.  This ensures that the counter can be 	*
 * used to detect resends of DATA_ACK packets; the counters for DATA_NOACK *
 * packets aren't currently used.  Other counters keep track of the 			*
 * last-sequentially-received packet ID (for DATA_ACK packets), so we		*
 * can check for resends & missed packets, and the last-sequentially-read	*
 * packet ID, so we can ensure the app reads the packets in order.			*
 *                                                                         *
 * If the protocol being used already guarantees delivery of packets,		*
 * no ACK is required for the packets.  In this case, the connection			*
 * class for this protocol can overload the Service routine to avoid			*
 * sending ACK packets, or the Connection Manager can just mark the			*
 * packet as ACK'd when it adds it to the Receive Queue for the connection.*
 *                                                                         *
 *	Derived classes must provide:															*
 * - Init: Initialization of any hardware-specific values.						*
 * - Send: a hardware-dependent send routine.										*
