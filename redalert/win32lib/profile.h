 * Overview:                                                                                   *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  New System                                                                                 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  The new profiler system creates a seperate thread and then starts a timer off there. The   *
 *  timer in the second thread uses GetThreadContext to sample the IP address of each user     *
 *  thread. This system has the advantage of being able to sample what is happening in all the *
 *  threads we own not just the main thread. Another advantage is that it doesnt require a     *
 *  major recompilation.                                                                       *
 *  The disadvantage is that we dont really know what is going on when the IP is outside the   *
 *  scope of our threads - We could be in direct draw, direct sound or even something like the *
 *  VMM and there is no way to tell.                                                           *
 *                                                                                             *
 *                                                                                             *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  Old System                                                                                 *
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~                                                                                 *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  The profiler works by using the function prologue and epilogue hooks available in Watcom   *
 *  to register the current functions address in a global variable and then sampling the       *
 *  contents of the variable using a windows timer which runs at up to 1000 samples per second.*
 *                                                                                             *
 *  Compile the code to be sampled with the -ep and -ee flags to enable the prologue (__PRO)   *
 *  and epilogue (__EPI) calls to be generated.                                                *
 *  At the beginning of the section to be profiled (just before main loop normally) call the   *
 *  Start_Profiler function to start sampling. At the end of the section, call Stop_Profiler   *
 *  which will stop the timer and write the profile data to disk in the PROFILE.BIN file.      *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  Use PROFILE.EXE to view the results of the session.                                        *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  The addition of prologue and epilogue code will slow down the product and the profiler     *
 *  allocates a huge buffer for data so it should not be linked in unless it is going to be    *
 *  used.                                                                                      *
 *                                                                                             *
 *  The advantage of the prologue/epilogue approach is that all samples represent valid        *
 *  addresses within our code so we get valid results we can use even when the IP is in system *
 *  code.                                                                                      *
